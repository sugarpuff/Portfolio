	    <p>
	    My name is Nour Abdul-Halim. I am a medical student, going to graduate in 2018, interested mainly in animation, coding, psychiatry and legal medicine. I got multiple hobbies like: sports(power lifting), playing video games and watching Anime. 
	    I studied a bit of programming in high school, mainly html and C#, but for personal reasons I had to focus on biology and chemistry. Now, after 6 years in which I realized that medicine might not be the career that will suit me, I met my boyfriend who supported me to pursue my old passion for programming and working in teams for making projects. That alone was enough to make me think of a future career in programming, so i looked up for opportunities that turned out to fail later. Up until I logged in one day on facebook, like any other day, and found an ad for Frond End Web Development scholarship by Udacity which raised my attention. Didn't have to think twice and I enrolled right away. Thanks to Udacity, today i managed to make this portfolio which represents just the beginning of a long creative and beautiful career. Hope my portfolio will catch your attention and seek my help ^^.
